    Lists:
      - If the given branch argument is not an instance of a list, then the branch argument will be set as a list.

    Errors:
      - If the delete value is not an instance of a boolean, then it raises an 'BooleanInstanceError' error.

    Operators:
      - If there a '*' in the 'argument_branch' list, Then it appends all existing branches to the 'argument_branch'
        list.

    Argument branch list loop:
      Errors:
        - If the branch value is not an instance of a string, then it raises an 'StringInstanceError' error.
        - If the branch is not in the 'branches' dictionary, it will throw a 'NotExistingBranchError' error.

      Branches list loop:
        Paint validator:
          - If there is a value in the value of the key branch of the 'paint_branch' dictionary, then the first element
            in the list 'total' is updated with the value + 1.
          - If there is a value in the value of the key branch of the 'paint_header' dictionary, then the first element
            in the list 'total' is updated with the value + 1.
          - Then the 'paint_layer' is looped through with the value of the key branch. For each 'layer' value, it is
            checked whether that layer/value has a value in the 'paint_layer' dictionary with the key branch. If there
            is no value in the 'layer' key, then the 'no_paint' variable is added with the value + 1. If the value of
            the 'no_paint' variable is equal to the value of the length of the 'paint_layer' dictionary with the key
            branch, then the first element in the list 'total' is updated with the value + 1.
          - If the first element in the 'total' list is equal to '3', the 'colored' variable becomes 'false'. Otherwise
            the 'colored' variable becomes 'true'.

        - Calls the 'Builder' class with the current value of branch as argument.
        - Calls the 'printer' function with the 'display_branch' action and the current 'branches_branch' and
          'argument_delete' argument.
